## Introduction

At KTTY WORLD Gaming Solutions Ltd., we believe that intellectual property (IP) rights are not just a legal formality; they are the foundation of Web3 ownership.

While many NFT projects continue to use community-owned NFTs in marketing campaigns without credit or compensation, we’re committed to doing things differently.

We’re proud to introduce the KTTY WORLD IP Rewards Framework, a community-first system that rewards our NFT holders whenever their NFT is used for promotional or commercial purposes by our project.

## The Value of Your NFT’s IP

When you purchase a KTTY WORLD NFT, you’re not just buying art; you’re investing in a digital identity that you own.

Your NFT may become iconic, recognizable, or representative of a movement within Web3. That has real value. We’ve seen time and time again in Web2 how brands license imagery, pay royalties, and respect creators’ rights.

In Web3, where ownership is on-chain and transparent, why should it be any different? This is why we’ve developed a transparent, automatic system to ensure you get paid when we use your NFT.

## The KTTY WORLD IP Rewards System

We’ve structured our reward system into three clear categories, based on the type of media and exposure involved:

## Use Case Definitions:

• Social Media Post (5 $RON):

Your NFT appears in a standard social media post (Twitter/X, Instagram, etc.) used to promote KTTY WORLD, an event, or initiative.

• Campaign Marketing (8 $RON):

Your NFT is featured in promotional assets such as banners, trailers, event posters, or email campaigns used for brand awareness or partnerships.

• Articles & Editorial (10 $RON):

Your NFT is used as a featured image or embedded in official articles, press releases, or educational content published by KTTY WORLD.

## Meet KORA: Our AI IP Management Assistant

To make this system scalable, efficient, and transparent, we’ve built KORA, our AI-powered modular ecosystem manager.

KORA continuously scans all KTTY WORLD content, from social media to blog posts and marketing decks, and cross-references every NFT image used with our on-chain ownership database. If she detects that the NFT used in our media belongs to a community member and not the core project, she automatically flags the usage, categorizes it, and issues the corresponding IP reward payment in $RON directly to the holder’s wallet.

This means:

• No forms to fill.

• No requests to submit.

• No delays.

Just real ownership and real reward, automatically.

## Why This Matters

We’re setting a new standard for what IP ownership in Web3 should look like:

• Empowering Creators:

Your NFT is a digital asset with utility and earning potential.

• Fostering Trust: Transparency and fair treatment strengthen our community bond.

• Real Utility: Beyond staking, governance, or metadata upgrades, IP rewards add a tangible economic layer to your NFT.

• Respecting Web3 Principles: Ownership on-chain means ownership with benefits, not just a JPG.

## How to Track Your IP Rewards

All payouts will be publicly trackable via our KTTY WORLD **Rewards Dashboard**, launching soon.

You’ll be able to:

• View usage logs

• Track earnings

• See how and where your NFT has appeared

KORA ensures these records are updated in real-time, and you can opt-in to receive notifications when your NFT is used.

## Implementation Notes

• Eligible NFTs:

Only NFTs purchased from verified KTTY WORLD collections are eligible for IP reward payments.

• Royalty Sync:

Rewards do not replace secondary royalties, but are additive, a new revenue layer.

• Team Transparency:

All project-owned NFTs will be disclosed publicly to avoid confusion over internal vs. community-owned NFTs.

• Opt-Out Option:

If you prefer not to have your NFT used in any promotions, you may opt out via your account settings on the dashboard.

## A Step Toward the Future

This system is more than just an incentive; it’s a statement of intent. At KTTY WORLD, we believe in building fairer ecosystems, where ownership means empowerment, and where your creativity and participation are respected and rewarded.

Whether you’re a collector, a builder, or just someone who loves great art, we’re here to make sure that your contributions matter in every sense of the word.

Let’s reshape what NFT ownership means, together.
