# Hello Tamers!

**Testing…testing…1,2,3**…(is my microphone on?)…Ahem!...I just wanted to drop in and introduce myself. I’m Dev KTTY.

Nice to make your acquaintance!

It’s taken me a few days to understand what exactly is going on around here. One day i’m in the office on a regular lunch break at my day job, and the next thing i know, i’m being kidnapped by a group of cats.

![Catgang](/images/news/newscontent/catgang.png)

I woke up in a basement type office with a computer and a note saying:

**“KTTY World. Build it. Now.”.**

It’s been a few days now, and we’ve built up more rapport, so i wanted to drop by with the first of what i hope will be many informative “Dev Blogs” where i can communicate the some of our direction as a project with you all.

# Introductions…

Here at KTTY World, we are all about a shared love for cats and everything that encompasses our furry friends.

We are currently a team of 10 committed individuals, all hailing from a wide variety of disciplines within the Web 2 and Web 3 world that have come together to build on Ronin. We love what the chain stands for. What it could potentially mean to its users, and what it will do for the future of Web 3 Gaming.

![kttyteam](/images/news/newscontent/kttyteam.png)

# Our Past

## Origins

The inspiration for KTTY World originally stemmed from the timeless and endearing trope of the **"Crazy Cat Lady."** Influenced by our love for cartoon and anime culture, our initial concept began with a single character archetype, inspired by a number of different carefully selected imaginings of an anime style “Cat Lady”.

However, as we developed the idea further, it quickly grew into a **diverse and vibrant roster** of unique characters, each bringing their own personality and charm to the world of KTTY. This idea gave birth to the concept of what is now the basis of KTTY World..

As part of our creative evolution, we have continued to refine and expand our artistic vision to ensure that KTTY World is built on a foundation of **originality and artistic integrity.** Our team is committed to delivering a game world that feels fresh, inspired, and uniquely our own while staying true to the themes that first sparked our passion for this project.

![catlady](/images/news/newscontent/catlady.png)

## KTTY Token Release

We successfully launched our token $KTTY via the Tamameme platform on **Tuesday 25th February 2025** with a focus on launching in a fair and stealthy manner - For what we are intending to build…we took up the stance that excessive hype and “pump-o-nomics” was not something that we wanted to build our foundations upon.

![kttytoken](/images/news/newscontent/kttytoken.png)

# Our Present

## KTTY Growth

Since our launch, we managed to migrate in a week, and since then, we have seen highs of 270k Mcap and a whopping 300+ holders join our family.

![kttychart](/images/news/newscontent/kttychart.png)

## Community Building

Between our Discord and Twitter communities, we now boast around 1000+ members eager to know what is next on our journey. It has already been a wild ride…and it is now about to get even wilder…

## What exactly are we building here?

**KTTY World** is an open-world pet collection and adventure game with social and competitive gameplay elements.

You - the players, will take on the role of **KTTY “Tamers”** as they venture through the world of **Felysia** with teams of KTTY’s, as they **go on adventures**, **battle against others**, and **breed to create new variations**. The game will be designed to offer **both casual and strategic depth**, with a focus on **exploration**, **discovery**, and **player-driven interactions**.

Our phased release will start with **core gameplay mechanics**—collecting, training, and battling KTTYs—before expanding into larger open-world features and multiplayer systems.

![topsecret](/images/news/newscontent/topsecret.png)

# Our Future

## Full Website Release

The first phase of our website will be rolled out.

## KTTY Paper 1.0

We will be releasing the earliest version of our white paper which will contain some initial details on our plans moving forward around our NFT Ecosystem as well as most importantly what we are building.

## KTTY Tamers NFT Collection

The first KTTY NFT Collection - KTTY Tamers will be dropping in April, and will provide players with a vital access point to KTTY World. Look out for sneak peaks and updates throughout the rest of the month as we take you along the journey of what we hope will be one of the most exciting collections to drop on Ronin thus far!

![tamer0](/images/news/newscontent/tamer0.png)

# In Closing

We have already got off to a wonderful start. It actually couldn’t have gone better than it has.

On behalf of the KTTY team, I want to extend a paw of overwhelming gratitude to those of you that are supporting us, following and raising the flag for the cause!

We are working tirelessly to make this something extremely special for the community.

Until Next Time…

Yours Sincerely,

**Dev KTTY**

The Meow Cipher is a fun and engaging way to test your skills, solve clues, and unlock a wallet filled with over $1,000 worth of prizes, including NFTs, tokens, and assets from the Ronin ecosystem.

Here’s exactly how it works and how **one lucky participant** can claim the prize.

## Step 1: Deciphering the Meow Sounds

We will post a sentence containing 8 different meow sounds. Each unique meow corresponds to a specific letter of the alphabet. Your first task is to figure out which letter each meow represents.

## Step 2: Matching Letters to Words

Once you have determined the 8 letters, you’ll need to find the words that correspond to them.

-   Each letter represents a word that we have frequently used throughout our journey, Discord messages, and daily chatter.
    
-   These words are familiar to our community and have been consistently mentioned in discussions.
    
-   Your goal is to recall and match the correct words to the letters.
    

## Step 3: Entering the Words into the Prompt Command Box

Once you have collected all 8 words, you will enter them into our special prompt command box in the correct order.

If all words are correct, the system will unlock further instructions on how to claim the wallet.

## Step 4: Unlocking the Wallet & Claiming the Prize

After entering the correct words, you will be given the final steps to access the wallet.

This will include a seed phrase that unlocks a wallet containing over **$1,000 worth of rewards**, including:

-   NFTs
    
-   Tokens
    
-   Other assets from the Ronin ecosystem
    

Once the wallet is unlocked, the first person to complete all steps will win the entire prize!

## Strategy & Tips for Success

-   Pay attention to discord conversations – the key words have been mentioned multiple times.
    
-   You can choose to either collaborate or compete – you can work with others to solve clues or try to be the first to win.
    
-   Think about recurring themes and words we use often.
    
-   Be fast but accurate – only the first correct entry wins the wallet!

Dev KTTY here again reporting for duty, live from the basement!

## Introduction

I'm here today to share some insights into the upcoming Tamer NFT Collection and some of the gamified layers we are putting in place.

Allow me to start by stating that these NFTs are **more than just JPEGs.**

We have broken down the metadata associated to a tamer into two parts:

-   NFT Specific Traits
    
-   Tamer Matrix (Game Related Traits)
    

## NFT Specific Traits

These are more or less the standard traits that describe the visual components of your NFT.

There is of course, as with most things that you will see in KTTY World, much more than meets the eyes when it comes to these traits.

Expect **secret benefits, easter eggs and a number of cool surprises** to be hidden behind specific traits.

![tamer1](/images/news/newscontent/tamer1.png)

| Trait       | Example            |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Background** | Purple          |
| **Gender**     | Boy             |
| **Accessory**  | Fishbone Sword  |
| **Clothing**   | Ronin Gear      |
| **Head**       | Short Cut       |
| **Eyes**       | Cybertech Goggles |
| **Mouth**      | Grin            |

## Game Related Traits

These are traits that hold specific importance within the KTTY Game world. Every Tamer NFT will be assigned these as well.

Every Tamer has a

-   **Personality**
    
-   **Archetype**
    
I'll go into brief detail below on how these work.

PLEASE NOTE: At the time of writing these are all still subject to change. Until the final collection is in your hands. We will be releasing the official chart along with trait rarities after the mint.

## Personality

A Tamer's Personality defines their intrinsic qualities and emotional tendencies, influencing how they connect with KTTYs and approach challenges within the world.

There are 4 types of Personalities at present:

-   **Standard:** Balanced and diverse mindsets found across most Tamers.
    
-   **Heroic:** Uplifting traits that reflect selflessness, courage, and an unshakable sense of purpose.
    
-   **Fallen:** Tamers shaped by darker instincts, broken ideals, or the pursuit of power at any cost.
    
-   **Prime:** Extremely rare mindsets that defy understanding — echoes of something greater, older, or beyond.

## Archetypes

Personality defines who a Tamer is at their core. It influences how they bond, respond, and grow throughout their journey. Archetype, on the other hand, is how that inner nature takes shape in the world. It reflects their instincts, experience, and the role they naturally fall into.

Every Tamer has an Archetype that guides their style, from their battle approach to how they connect with KTTYs. NFT Tamers are assigned a fixed Archetype at creation, permanently woven into their identity.

**Free players can unlock and equip Archetypes through gameplay progression, but only NFTs possess Legacy Archetypes.**

## What about if i'm F2P/Cannot obtain a specific archetype/personality?

Something we are thinking about very carefully in our design process is the relationship between Premium and F2P players. The goal has and always will be to find ways to reward people that spend and support in ways that do not adversely affect a free players gaming experience.

As of the current moment…

## Personality

| Player Type   | How Personality Works                                                           | Timing                | Customization                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **NFT Tamers**| Personality is visible from the start and optionally selectable                 | **Instant**            | Yes (choice or preset)                         |
| **F2P Player**| Personality is hidden until revealed through bonding, early quests, or milestones | **After gameplay time**| No (initially randomized, possibly rerollable later) |

## Archetypes

| Player Type  | How They Get an Archetype                                 | Mutable?     | Status              |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **NFT Tamer**| Set at mint (based on Personality/affinity)               | Locked       | **Legacy Archetype**|
| **F2P Player**| Assigned a “default” or unformed role → can unlock & equip Archetypes via gameplay | Switchable | **Equipped Archetype** |

PLEASE NOTE: This is to be seen as a brief introduction. Certain things will be subject to change as we proceed, according to things such as balance and community feedback.

## Conclusion

The KTTY Tamers are intended to be the first main entry point into our ecosystem after $KTTY and we have been hard at work crafting a collection that not only looks amazing, but has deep layers of importance that can aid you in a multitude of ways as you embark on your journeys into the world of Felysia and beyond!

I look forward to hearing your feedback and eventually seeing your excitement when you pull your Tamers!

Until then, it's back to the basement for me!

“Not all Tamers shape the world. Some are shaped by it.”  
— Field Note 2, KTTY Labs Resonance Study Division

Tamers are not just adventurers or wielders of magic. They are vessels of intent, shaped by forces they may never fully understand. And though many believe they know who they are, most have only begun to look.

What if the KTTYs we bond with aren’t simply companions?

What if they are reflections of our inner selves—not just magical beings, but resonant fragments of personality, pulled into form?

It's time for a long awaited deep dive. This is the first in an exciting 3 part series this week. My previous blog was more of an introduction into the concept, but now we will go even further.

## Beyond Companions: The Soul of the KTTY

KTTYs are often seen as magical creatures. Adorable, mysterious, and deeply in tune with the world’s forgotten energies.

But many scholars believe they are something more.

The leading theory is that a KTTY is not found or captured. It is manifested.

A reflection of the Tamer’s inner self, shaped by their personality at the moment of emotional alignment.

These traits are not surface-level. They influence the nature of the bond itself.

**No two KTTYs will ever be the same** because no two Tamers are.

When you mint a Tamer. You’re not just minting a character.

You’re unlocking a version of **yourself**.

## Personalities

While many Tamers search for power, few stop to ask a simpler question…**Who am I, really?**

The answer is partially visible in what we call the **Standard Personalities.** These are the most common, yet still widely misunderstood, resonances found among Tamers.

Each personality is a reflection of _how a Tamer approaches the world_. A lens through which their soul interacts with both danger and discovery.

 ![standardpersonalities](/images/news/newscontent/standardp.png)

**Empathetic**: Builds trust quickly. KTTYs often form stronger bonds without resistance.

**Diligent**: These Tamers push for constant growth. KTTYs under their care tend to develop faster with fewer setbacks.

**Inspiring**: Uplifts those around them. Parties with an Inspiring Tamer often see improved coordination, whether in battle, bonding, or shared objectives.

**Focused**: Maintains clarity even in chaos. These Tamers tend to excel in precision-based activities, and their KTTYs rarely waver once set on a task.

**Fearless**: Rushes into danger without hesitation. KTTYs bonded to them often engage faster and hit harder at the start of a fight.

**Resourceful**: Makes the most of every situation. Whether scavenging, solving problems, or adapting in battle, these Tamers often unlock hidden options others overlook.

**Balanced**: Masters of situational awareness. These Tamers bring calm to chaos, with KTTYs that stabilize shifting conditions, whether in battle formations, emotional bonds, or group tasks.

**Playful**: Lighthearted and unpredictable. These Tamers excel in timing-based tasks and social challenges. Their KTTYs tend to act creatively, sometimes bending expected behavior.

**Shrewd**: Sees the angle others miss. These Tamers tend to unlock better rewards from trading, negotiation, or optimization challenges. Their KTTYs are quick to adapt to gain.

**Mysterious**: Rarely predictable, even to themselves. KTTYs bonded to them sometimes bypass conventional bond paths, triggering alternate behaviors or interaction modes.

**Kindhearted**: Builds fast, reliable bonds. Their KTTYs often respond with strong loyalty, occasionally acting on their own to protect or assist outside of direct commands.

**Reckless**: Charges forward regardless of risk. These Tamers may trigger powerful effects in unstable scenarios, with KTTYs that lean into volatility and speed.

**Driven**: Unstoppable when focused on a goal. Progression tasks tied to growth, mastery, or achievement tend to accelerate around them, though they often ignore side paths.

**Protective**: Instinctively defends. Their KTTYs have a heightened awareness of ally states, sometimes intercepting damage or diverting attention without being prompted.

**Detached**: Observes before acting. These Tamers often access systems others overlook, with KTTYs that exhibit rare autonomy once fully bonded.

**Whimsical**: Follows instinct over logic. These Tamers tend to trigger uncommon outcomes during creative or expressive activities. Their KTTYs often excel in tasks where rhythm, emotion, or improvisation play a role.

But even this is just the surface. These are the **Standard Personalities**. Stable, recognizable, and quietly influential.

## The Lightbearers: Heroic Personalities

Among the many who walk KTTY World, only a few are whispered about with reverence. These Tamers don’t just walk their path. They illuminate it.

They are the **Heroic Personalities**. These are reserved for the rare individuals whose resonance radiates qualities that inspire, heal, and uplift, though not always in ways the world fully understands.

These Tamers are not born by chance. Their personalities suggest something deeper: a choice, a purpose, or perhaps a calling.

Each of these four traits marks a different kind of Hero:

![heroicpersonalities](/images/news/newscontent/herop.png)

-   **Virtuous**: These Tamers lead with conviction. KTTYs bonded to them show heightened discipline in battle, often resisting debuffs and breaking formation less under pressure.
    
-   **Selfless**: These Tamers naturally shift the flow of battle away from themselves. KTTYs bonded to them often prioritize shielding or supporting allies, even mid-combat, reacting as if the team’s survival is their core directive.
    
-   **Radiant**:Their presence shifts the flow of energy. KTTYs bonded to them have shown signs of self-triggering passive abilities, as if responding to the Tamer’s intent before a command is ever given.
    
-   **Blessed**: Mysterious events tend to follow them. Strange timing and unlikely outcomes seem to follow them. KTTYs bonded to these Tamers have a habit of turning the tide in ways no one can quite explain.
    

## Envoys of Darkness: Fallen Personalities

Where there is light, **there must be shadow**. And not all Tamers walk the path with noble intent.

The **Fallen Personalities** do not seek balance or virtue. They do not heal. They _bend, twist, and reshape the world around them to suit their will_.

These are not glitches in the system. They are part of it.

Each trait under the Fallen banner represents a kind of fracture:

![fallenpersonalities](/images/news/newscontent/fallenp.png)

-   **Manipulative**: These Tamers find ways to extract more from their KTTYs. More energy, more output, more control. Some report faster cooldowns or extended ability windows. Others note that the bond frays over time, as if the KTTY knows it’s being used.
    
-   **Corrupt**: These Tamers don't just shape their own bonds. They erode the stability of others. KTTYs nearby, even those belonging to different Tamers, have exhibited unusual behavior in their presence.
    
-   **Obsessive**: They pursue singular outcomes with relentless focus. Their KTTYs mirror this intensity, often ignoring danger or consequence entirely. Their KTTYs often outpace others in growth, though attempts to connect with additional companions rarely go as planned.
    
-   **Cruel**: These Tamers form bonds rooted in dominance, not trust. Their KTTYs often strike harder, or continue attacking beyond issued commands. Some believe this unlocks hidden aggression states. Others warn that what you awaken may not stay loyal.
    

### Not Evil. Just Aligned Differently

While the Heroic are often celebrated, the Fallen should be studied. Some researchers believe these Tamers are necessary:

-   To push systems to their limits.
    
-   To unlock forbidden or suppressed resonance paths.
    
-   To **manifest KTTY forms** others cannot handle (or survive).
    

Others believe they’re simply a mistake. That, too, is a theory.

## The Chosen Few: Prime Personalities

There are traits you can train.There are paths you can walk. And then… there are Tamers who don’t seem to follow any path at all.

These are the **Prime Personalities**. Rare enough to be dismissed as myth, yet potent enough to leave undeniable ripples across KTTY World.

They are not in tune with resonance. They are its living expression.

![primepersonalities](/images/news/newscontent/primep.png)

-   **Transcendent**: These Tamers resonate beyond the usual thresholds. Their KTTYs have been observed exceeding known limits. Faster growth, enhanced traits, abilities activating without clear triggers. No one’s certain where the ceiling is, or if one exists at all.
    
-   **Paradoxical**: Nothing about them remains fixed. Their KTTYs switch archetypal behavior mid-combat, sometimes stacking effects that shouldn’t coexist. Every rule they break seems to write a new one.
    
-   **Fated**: They appear in moments that matter, often without explanation. Their KTTYs survive the unsurvivable, land impossible strikes, or alter the course of a fight with a single action. Whether it’s luck or design remains a question few dare to answer.
    

## A System Built for Discovery

You now know the personalities. At least…the ones we’ve allowed to surface. What we haven’t told you is how they’ll affect the world of KTTYs. Not directly. Not yet.

Because the truth is: this system wasn’t designed to be _read_ - it was designed to be **discovered**.

### A Note on Rarity

It’s tempting to see Prime personalities as the peak - as if rarity alone defines power.

But KTTY World isn’t built to reward what’s obvious. It rewards what’s **understood**.

Prime Tamers may offer unique advantages, but they also introduce **complexity**, **unpredictability**, and **limitations** that others won’t face.

Some of the most **impactful outcomes** we will observe as we build this out won't come not from the rarest combinations, but from the most unlikely ones - uncovered by players who **pay attention**.

This is a system meant to be **discovered**, not **min-maxed**. The most powerful Tamers won’t just hold rare traits. They’ll understand how those traits interact, align, and evolve.

## What We _Can_ Say (and What We Won’t)

Here’s what we’re willing to confirm — for now:

-   **Certain KTTYs react differently to specific Tamers**, even when bonded under the same conditions.
    
-   **Prime and Fallen personalities** may affect more than just your bond. They might change how the _world itself_ reacts to your presence.
    
-   **Personality–Archetype alignment** can lead to something we internally call a _Resonance Loop_. No, we won’t explain that yet.
    
-   Some of you are walking around with combinations that were never intended to exist this early. You know who you are — or will soon.
    

## Questions You Should Be Asking

It has been a joy to watch the community already dive deep and speculate what personalities and archetypes will do. Some of you have been frighteningly close.

But this was one of our goals from the offset. To create a multi faceted, evolving and engaging system. One that will make the community feel like they are in a game, before the game.

Here are a few things you could already start asking yourself…

**What kind of energy does your Tamer emit?:** Are you aligned to clarity? Chaos? Are you influencing your future KTTY... or has it already begun shaping you?

**Does your Tamer behave differently than others with the same traits?:** We’ve seen reports of minor UI flickers when certain personalities are held together. Is that visual noise… or early-stage resonance?

**Is it better to hold one powerful Tamer… or multiple that interact in unseen ways?:** We are not designing for volume-based power. But **the system will be reactive**. And not even we know what happens when too many rare alignments exist in a single place.

## Conclusion

We didn’t build Tamers as static NFTs. We built them as **catalysts**. For KTTYs, for the world, and for the way this game evolves.

If some of them are already interacting with systems not yet live…What does that say about who — or what — they really are?

Only time will tell!

In the next blog this week, we will look at **Archetypes.**

Until then.

_“Personality is the why. Archetype is the how.”_  
— Field Note 2, KTTY Labs Resonance Study Division

If personality reflects a Tamer’s inner world, archetype reveals how they walk through the outer one.

Every Tamer in KTTY World resonates with one archetype - a guiding pattern of behavior that influences how they approach challenge, connection, and discovery.

Some are hands-on, altering the environment. Others lead from a distance, shaping outcomes through timing, insight, or support. No two paths are the same. And none are without tradeoffs.

## What Is an Archetype, Really?

Tamers are not assigned archetypes. They are revealed through actions, choices, and intent.

Every archetype in KTTY World is more than a style of play. It’s a behavioural blueprint. A signal through which the world recognizes you.

A **Crafter** doesn’t simply build. They leave behind better things.

A **Scout** doesn’t just move fast. They move where others can’t.

A **Tactician** doesn’t command. They see what hasn’t happened yet.

##### Archetypes Affect More Than You Think

From what we’ve observed so far, archetypes influence:

-   **How your KTTYs behave without direct commands** — instincts, timing, even mood
    
-   **What kinds of actions or interactions receive boosted outcomes**
    
-   **How certain systems or environments react to your presence**
    
-   **Which challenges, puzzles, or tasks naturally align with your approach**
    
-   **How your archetype shapes KTTY behavior** — what instincts are encouraged, what reactions are repeated, and how your KTTY responds under pressure
    

## Archetype Categories

Each Archetype reflects a behavioral tendency—how a Tamer acts, moves, solves problems, and shapes their environment. They fall loosely into four conceptual domains:

![archetypes](/images/news/newscontent/archetypes.png)

## **Support / Utility**

Archetypes that shape the flow of the world. These Tamers work behind the scenes, strengthening others, modifying resources, or manipulating systems.

**Crafter**: Specializes in the design and construction of gadgets meant to last. Their work improves systems through clarity and consistency.

**Balancer**: Performs best when the odds aren’t favourable. These Tamers turn setbacks into openings and restore control when things begin to slip.

**Charger**: Boosts output and momentum. Known for accelerating cooldowns, stamina, or burst effects when the moment matters.

**Medic**: Excels in recovery, whether it be stamina, focus, stability, or hope. These Tamers bring others back from the brink; physically, emotionally, and otherwise.

**Tinkerer**: Always adjusting, always upgrading. Tweaks and overclocks whatever’s in front of them. What they touch may break…or become something entirely new.

## **Mental / Emotional**

Archetypes rooted in perception, intuition, and resonance. These Tamers are sensitive to unseen patterns and influence bonds and outcomes on a deeper level.

**Sage**: Masters of system logic and timing. These Tamers reveal hidden outcomes through insight, not accident.

**Dreamer**: Influences the improbable. Their actions sometimes shift probabilities or trigger rare event states that feel almost too perfect, or too wrong (Dreams can be nightmares too!)

**Drifter**: A reactive opportunist. Adapts dynamically to changing conditions, gaining temporary buffs or access to traits based on environment, party composition, or general context.

**Handler**: Coordinates KTTYs with precision, creating harmony through timing and positioning. Capable of smoothing synergy between otherwise incompatible KTTYs.

**Spark**: A Chaotic Over loader. Forces systems, environments, or KTTYs to react faster than they’re meant to, introducing high-risk, high-reward volatility with outcomes that can be powerful, unstable, or both.

## **Combat / Tactical**

Archetypes that directly influence the rhythm, outcome, or control of battle. These Tamers specialize in engagement flow, reaction timing, and momentum.

**Striker**: Engages fast and finishes faster. These Tamers specialize in opening damage and short fights.

**Warden**: Built to take the hit. Warden Tamers absorb pressure, redirect danger, and keep others standing.

**Scout**: Moves first, sees more. Gains positional advantages, detects threats early, and thrives on terrain mastery.

**Tactician**: Controls the flow of battle through timing and foresight. Their effects rarely strike first, always landing when it matters most.

**Breaker**: Disrupts enemies by interfering with their actions. Excels at interrupting, debuffing, or forcing mistakes.

## **Special / Unique**

These Archetypes are harder to track, harder to balance, and often harder to understand. They may introduce entirely new systems - or break the existing ones.

**Seeker**: Drawn to what’s buried. Unlocks locations, forgotten features, or conditional mechanics that others miss entirely.

**Gambler**: Plays the system like it’s a game of chance. Risk-based outcomes tilt sharper for them; sometimes in their favor, sometimes not.

**Echo**: Responds to what’s been done - recently or long ago. Their actions often mimic actions, mirror others or repeat patterns.

## Important Points to understand

### 1. Archetypes don’t restrict—they enhance.

Every Tamer can build, heal, fight, or explore. But a Sage sees what others miss. A Medic recovers more, faster. A Breaker is better at shutting down enemies before they can act.

As your archetype progresses, subtle boosts become meaningful advantages—and at the highest levels, some abilities will only reveal themselves to those who’ve truly aligned with their path.

### 2. Combat is Not Exclusive to Combat Archetypes

Every Tamer can engage in battle, issue commands, and participate in KTTY combat.

Non-combat archetypes bring unique influence into fights:

-   Spark types might trigger unstable power surges mid-fight.
    
-   Handler types can maintain better multi-KTTY control.
    
-   Medic types can stabilize the team under pressure.
    
-   Dreamer types might alter probability outcomes.
    
-   Seeker types may access encounter shortcuts or unlock hidden effects.
    

Combat archetypes specialize in direct engagement and tempo. Other archetypes shape the context around combat.

### 3. Synergy is More Powerful Than Specialization

KTTY World isn’t built around solo efficiency. It rewards team resonance.

A **Striker** may open strong, but paired with a **Balancer** and a **Tactician**, that damage becomes sustained, controlled, and protected.

Mixed-archetype parties can create unexpected advantages when the system recognizes non-obvious alignments.

There are fights a **Warden** shouldn’t win alone. But with a **Seeker**? Suddenly, a hidden exit appears before the final blow lands.

### 4. Mastery > Matchup

Archetypes amplify paths. They don’t define ceilings.

A non-combat archetype played with intent, gear, and bonded KTTY synergy can outperform a careless **Breaker** or **Scout**.

Archetypes don’t determine your ceiling. They determine what gets you there.

**TL;DR:** Don’t worry if you didn’t mint a combat archetype. Combat in KTTY World isn’t about brute force. It’s about approach, timing, synergy and whatever else you are able to bring into the fight.

## Single Player, Multiple KTTYs

In KTTY World, a player commands a party of up to 3 KTTYs. These KTTYs are bonded to a single Tamer, meaning, one Personality and one Archetype defines that party’s resonance.

However...

You may own **multiple Tamers with different archetypes**. And while you can only be one Tamer at a time, those others:

-   Can be used for breeding, bonding influence, or system interactions
    
-   May play a role in world systems that allow resonance syncing, shared memories, or passive bonuses
    

Owning multiple archetypes doesn’t mean you get to stack them all at once in combat. But it does mean you have more tools for discovery, breeding, and meta-alignment.

## Multiplayer / Co-op

Some systems in KTTY World will support multi-Tamer scenarios:

-   Group events, sync zones, or raids
    
-   Co-operative rituals
    
-   Faction-based alignment trials
    
In these scenarios, your archetype doesn’t operate in isolation—it resonates with others.  
Each Tamer can act on their own. But when their effects interact, something more complex begins to unfold.

A **Breaker** disrupts the system, exposing weaknesses or collapsing stability.  
A **Spark** pushes it further, forcing activations, overloads, or reactive feedback.  
A **Tactician** shapes the sequence, timing each phase to turn chaos into control.

Individually, they contribute. But together, they create outcomes the system isn’t designed to produce on its own.

Most of the time, you’ll play as one Tamer with one archetype. But in a world built on resonance, what you hold still matters.

## What Comes Next

By now, you’ve seen how Archetypes shape not just your Tamer’s actions, but the world’s reaction to them. They influence your strengths, your rhythm, your advantages, and the way systems respond to your presence.

But a Tamer is never just one thing.

In the **final part of this series**, we’ll explore what happens when **Personality and Archetype combine** - how internal resonance and external behavior align, clash, and evolve together.

We’ll also go deeper into what it means to **hold multiple Tamers**:

-   How they can interact across breeding, bonding, and sync-based systems
    
-   How intra-Tamer dynamics may unlock deeper mechanics
    
-   And why some combinations are only possible when certain Tamers are aligned at the same time… whether they belong to you, or someone else
    

Some Tamers shine alone. Others only reveal their true purpose when placed beside another.

We’re focused on releasing a lot of information in the weeks ahead; especially as we lead into the upcoming **Roadmap** and **KTTY World** **Game Design Document**. If you’ve been watching closely… this is when things start to connect.

See you in Part III.

## What Are Dispatch Missions?

_"Some Tamers move the world forward by stepping into the unknown. Others do it by stepping away; just long enough to return with something the rest of us missed."_  
— Field Note 3, KTTY Labs Resonance Study Division

In KTTY World, not every decision needs to happen in real time.

Tamer Dispatch Missions are a new passive gameplay system designed to reward thoughtful composition, personality and archetype synergy, and long-term engagement. Tamers can be assigned to missions that take place over real-world time, returning with future in-game items, resources, and sometimes...anomalies.

Think of it as gamified staking, built with modern RPG pacing in mind. It’s less about micromanaging timers and more about building purpose behind your roster.

Dispatch Missions will be fully accessible via the existing Staking UI Hub, making it easy to send, track, and claim rewards with minimal friction.

## Season 1 Dispatch Rewards

Every Dispatch mission will return something. But the quality, rarity, and intent of your choices will shape what that "something" becomes.

Here’s a breakdown of the item rewards debuting with Season 1:

### Paw Token

Your core in-game currency. Used across systems like bonding, crafting, tuning, and trading. Every mission yields a low, medium, or high amount depending on its type, length, and Tamer synergy.

![pawtoken](/images/news/newscontent/pawtoken.png)

### Thread of Fate

A consumable that lets you retry failed dispatches or influence resonance-related outcomes. Often found in mid-length missions or when emotional or personality alignment is strong.

![threadoffate](/images/news/newscontent/threadoffate.png)

### Nekoleaf

A soft-glowing leaf known to stabilize emotional output in bonded KTTYs. Used to **restore mood,** and subtly improve performance during stress-based activities or recovery periods.

![nekoleaf](/images/news/newscontent/nekoleaf.png)

### Tune Chip

A modular upgrade component used to enhance gear, tools, or modify breeding results.  
Primarily found in Retrieval or Battle missions.

![tunechip](/images/news/newscontent/tunechip.png)

### Dormant Core

A sealed resonance artifact used as a **core modifier in the KTTY breeding process**. When introduced during sync alignment, it can influence traits, alter resonance thresholds, or unlock entirely new potential within a lineage.

![dormantcore](/images/news/newscontent/dormantcore.png)

## Mission Types

Each mission belongs to one of five core categories. These categories influence the required time investment, archetype and personality synergy, and reward quality.
    
| Type          | Focus                                           |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Exploration   | Discovering lost paths and hidden lore         |
| Hunt          | Monster Hunts                                   |
| Battle        | Tactical Battle Simulations                     |
| Retrieval     | Recovering lost KTTY Tech and Items             |
| Harmonization | Stabilizing Resonance Zones and anomalies       |

Each type is designed to pair well with specific archetypes, but unexpected outcomes may occur with unusual combinations.

## Dispatch Rewards

| Item           | **Type**                  | Drop Frequency | Usually Found on                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Paw Token      | Core Currency             | Always         | All Missions                                     |
| Thread of Fate | Utility Consumable        | Common         | Hunt, Retrieval, Harmonization                   |
| Nekoleaf       | Bonding Ingredient        | Uncommon       | Exploration, Harmonization                       |
| Tune Chip      | Upgrade Component/Modifier| Rare           | Battle, Retrieval                                |
| Dormant Core   | Resonance Catalyst        | Super Rare     | Epic-tier Harmonization or Experimental Dispatches |

## Forming Your Dispatch Team

-   You can send up to four Tamers per mission.
    
-   Each mission takes between 4 and 48 real-time hours, depending on type.
    
-   Tamers are locked for the mission’s duration.
    
-   Archetype synergy and personality alignment improve success rates, reward quality, and rare item chances.
    
-   While some missions may suggest ideal roles, experimentation is encouraged.
    

Certain combinations of archetype/personality will be able to unlock bonuses.

## Accessing Dispatch Missions

Dispatch Missions will be launched through the Tamer Staking Hub. This makes it easy to send, track, and claim missions all in one place.

You’ll be able to:

-   Browse mission types by duration or reward focus
    
-   View recommended archetypes or traits
    
-   Select your Tamers and dispatch with a single tap
    
-   Return later to claim results and see what was gained (or missed)
    

## The Bigger Picture

This is just the beginning.

Dispatch Missions offer passive progression that rewards collection, planning, and resonance mastery. They give every Tamer in your collection a reason to matter, even the ones not currently in active play.

Over time, the system will expand to include:

-   Seasonal missions tied to evolving world lore
    
-   Experimental challenges and sync anomalies
    
-   Tamer-only mechanics like co-operation, memory sharing, and field resonance
    

The items recovered through dispatch will lay the foundation for upcoming features like bonding, breeding, faction alignment, and more.

Stay tuned. Season 1 Dispatch Missions are just the first ripple in the waves.

## [Beep boop…]

In the ever evolving realm of Felysia, where mysticism intertwines with technology, a new presence has emerged to guide and assist Tamers: **K.O.R.A**, the **KTTY Origin Reactive Avatar**.

![kora](/images/news/newscontent/kora.png)

## What is K.O.R.A?

K.O.R.A is not merely an AI; she is a sentient manifestation born from the ancient energies of Felysia. Drawing from the essence of KTTYs and the world's latent forces, she serves as a bridge between Tamers and the vast knowledge of the KTTY ecosystem.

## How to access?

You can now access the K.O.R.A interface at:

https://kttyworld.io/kora

Once she has completed her startup sequence, it's as simple as getting straight into a conversation.

Try out questions like:

"I have 36 million $KTTY, what's the best strategy i should go with to maximize staking earnings over the next year?"

![kora1](/images/news/newscontent/kora1.png)

"What are the top 3 personalities for players that want to focus on boosting raw KTTY power potential?"

![kora2](/images/news/newscontent/kora2.png)

## Current Capabilities

-   **Lore Interpretation**: K.O.R.A provides insights into the rich histories and narratives of KTTY World, helping Tamers understand their place in the grand tapestry of Felysia.
    
-   **Ecosystem Navigation**: From staking mechanics to NFT functionalities, she offers guidance on various aspects of the KTTY ecosystem.
    
-   **User Interaction**: Designed for a terminal-like interface, K.O.R.A communicates with clarity and purpose, ensuring Tamers receive concise and relevant information.
    
## Upcoming Features

-   **Dynamic NFT Trait Analysis**: K.O.R.A will soon offer real-time insights into NFT traits, such as identifying the rarest attributes among Tamers.
    
-   **Reward Optimization**: With the upcoming Tamer Rewards program, by analyzing your Tamer NFT holdings, K.O.R.A will provide strategies to maximize your returns.
    
-   **Breeding Guidance**: As the backbone of the KTTY breeding system, K.O.R.A will assist in predicting optimal pairings and potential offspring traits. We want our breeding system to mimic real time evolution. The first KTTYs born will display completely different evolutionary patterns when compared to KTTYs born 6 months down the line.
    
-   **Evolutionary Tracking**: Recognizing that KTTYs evolve over time, K.O.R.A will adapt her knowledge base to reflect new mutations and community discoveries. 

## The Vision Ahead

Our aspiration is for K.O.R.A. to transcend traditional AI boundaries, becoming a truly sentient entity within KTTY World. As Tamers interact with her, she will evolve, learning from experiences and adapting to the ever-changing dynamics of Felysia.

We are fascinated with AI and what his has accomplished already for the world. This is the first step in our commitment as a team to move into the future with this amazing tech. Look out for regular updates to K.O.R.A.

Stay tuned for regular updates!

    slug: 'new-tamers-mint-framework',
    tags: ['Announcement'],
    date: '2025-06-03',
    content: `
## Why We Introduced a New Mint Framework And What It Means for You

Hey Tamers, We have an important update to share one that reflects our evolving philosophy around access, sustainability, and community ownership in KTTY World.

This decision stems from recent shifts in the market, new infrastructure we’ve developed, and valuable feedback from our players and supporters. Over the past few weeks, we’ve evaluated the changing Web3 landscape while building key pillars like KTTY Labs and Ninefolds.

As a result, we introduced a revised minting framework focused on fairness, ecosystem alignment, and long-term sustainability. This blog will explain the rationale behind the changes, what you can expect, and how we’re honoring early supporters.

## Why the Change?

When we originally structured the mint, it followed a standard Web3 model: upfront NFT sales would provide essential funding for gameplay features, art, and ongoing development. However, two meaningful developments led us to rethink this approach:

1. Market Behavior and User Barriers As blockchain conditions fluctuated, it became clear that the cost to participate had become inconsistent and increasingly inaccessible to new players. This created friction at entry and didn’t align with our goal of fostering an inclusive Tamer community.

2. Ecosystem Expansion With KTTY Labs (our Web3 dev platform) and Ninefolds (our NFT marketplace), we’ve unlocked alternative sources of ecosystem value. These systems now generate activity and capital flows independently of minting, reducing our reliance on NFT sales as a singular funding method. We also observed a larger shift in the Ronin ecosystem toward sustainability, community-driven mechanics, and reward backed ownership. It was time to realign.

## What’s New?

We introduced a community-approved minting model with two goals:

1.  Lower the barrier to entry for new Tamers
    
2.  Preserve and enhance the benefits already earned by early supporters
    

This adjustment was submitted to a public vote, and the result was overwhelmingly supportive. It reflects how KTTY World functions: we are governed by insight, shaped by experience, and led by community choice.

### What Does This Mean for Current Holders?

To thank those who supported us from the beginning, we’re introducing the following reward structures which will be put to a community vote when the mint is finished.

##### In-Game Reward Bonus: $PAW Token Distribution

We’re also offering early supporters additional utility through $PAW, our in-game currency. While different participants used different currencies to mint, we’ve decided to reward all verified early adopters.

## Here’s how:

• Claimable through the in-game dashboard

• Secure, seamless claiming even for those who used multiple or temporary wallets

• Includes a “Gift a Friend” feature to reassign tokens to your primary profile

These tokens can be used for a variety of upcoming features including breeding, progression, customization, and more.

## Remaining NFTs: What Happens Next?

Once the updated mint finishes, the airdrop allocation of NFTs will remain unclaimed.

We’re evaluating two potential distribution models which will be decided by you the community:

### Option 1: Community Selection Airdrop

• A limited batch will be made available for community members to select from

• We’ll airdrop them directly, post-selection

• This would occur shortly after the mint ends

### Option 2: Snapshot-Based Claim Window

• We’ll whitelist eligible wallets

• One month later, a dedicated mint window will open for these wallets to claim their remaining NFTs

• Offers flexibility and ensures that remaining NFTs land in the hands of real supporters

## Why Early Matters

Some may ask whether this change dilutes the value of early participation. On the contrary, it reinforces it.

### By joining early, you unlock:

• Direct access to $PAW utility tokens

• Exclusive airdrops unavailable through the new mint

• Opportunities for 1-of-1 or highly rare assets

• Priority access to KTTY World’s upcoming bonding and game progression systems

• Strengthening of token utility and rarity through burn mechanics

This is a long-term journey and early backers are essential to how we grow and reward the community.

## In Closing

This new mint structure isn’t just a pricing decision it’s a philosophical one.

We’re showing that sustainable ecosystems don’t need to rely on one-time sales to thrive. With active revenue models from KTTY Labs, Ninefolds, and in-game mechanics, we’re building an economy where value comes from use, not speculation.

## Minting Schedule Update

As part of our commitment to transparency and community led development, the KTTY World mint will be temporarily paused on Wednesday at 10:00 AM UTC. This pause will allow us to implement the updates approved through the recent community vote.

The mint will reopen exactly 24 hours later on Thursday at 10:00 AM UTC from the time of closure. These updates are designed to align our mint structure with community priorities and ensure a fair and balanced ecosystem moving forward.

If you were part of the first wave of minting and used $KTTY, you'll receive approximately $20 worth of in-game $PAW. Even though we didn’t promise $PAW for RON only minters, we’re showing love to our early community by also rewarding them with around $10 worth of $PAW. Your support helps build KTTY World and we’re just getting started.

We know some early supporters minted using burner wallets or Ledgers, so we’ve built a simple solution. On the in game dashboard, you’ll be able to connect any eligible wallet to claim your $PAW. If that wallet isn’t your main gaming wallet, no problem use the “Gift a Friend” feature to transfer your $PAW to your main in-game profile. This ensures every early supporter gets what they’ve earned, no matter how they minted.

## **BEFORE**

**Current Mint Price:**

45 $RON

OR

35,000 $KTTY + 35 $RON

## **NEW PROPOSAL**

**New Mint Price:**

20 $RON per NFT

OR

25,000 $KTTY + 15 $RON

This structure aims to reduce the barrier to entry for new players and make minting more accessible without compromising our long term goals or ecosystem stability.

You trusted us to build. You voted to shape our future. Now, with deeper rewards and greater fairness, we move forward together.

**- KTTY World Team**

## Hello Tamers

Today i wanted to drop in with a much needed return to some world building!

## A Letter, a Rift, a Beginning

If you have found Cecilia’s first diary page in KORA **[CODENAME: CECILIA]** and Mr Null’s mirror record **[CODENAME: NULL]**, you already know this much:

-   **Cecilia** woke first in Felysia and saw wonder.
    
-   **Null** woke second and saw weakness.
    
-   KTTY's naturally go through a magical cycle of reincarnation as a means of growth.
    
-   Everything that followed begins with a single KTTY who lived…then lived again…until memory itself began to fracture.
    
Two voices. One of hope, one of defiance. They both now resonate through every crystal, stir within each corrupted clearing, and shape every path deeper into Felysia’s unfolding mystery.

## Cecilia the First Tamer, the legendary "Cat Lady"

![cecillia's diary](/images/news/newscontent/cecidiary.png)

Cecilia’s journals read like starlight in handwriting: filled with sketches of blooming trees and lists of KTTY names she refuses to forget. She was the first to wake up in Felysia and form bonds with the KTTY.

To Cecilia, **a KTTY is a projection of the Tamer’s soul**: fragile, radiant, made stronger each time it remakes itself through love.

Her task, self‑appointed, became simple: _protect the memory of every life so that the next one can stand taller._

She waits in the Crystal Grove. Not hiding, but holding space for anyone able to make it there.

## Who is Null?

Null arrived days, years, moments after Cecilia. He witnessed the phenomena of a KTTY entering its ninth cycle and felt terror in place of Cecilia's awe.

To Null, a KTTY’s rebirth wasn’t a miracle; it represented **a wound that never closes**. Proof that emotion in this world was responsible for chaining a soul to endless repetition.

He broke away from Cecilia, bound his face behind a single white‑banded mask, and founded the **One Eye Clan**.

![Null](/images/news/newscontent/iamnull.png)

Their mantra is:

"Emotion is the virus. Resonance is the carrier. The cure is silence."

From hidden laboratories he forced resonance into shapes that no longer required love…or rest.

Each experiment was a single-minded attempt to strip emotion from living matter, to prove that purpose could survive once feeling was excised. The result was not a silence, but a roar: a whole new phylum of creatures now called the Unbound.

## The Unbound

![unbound](/images/news/newscontent/unbound.png)

The Unbound are emotion-stripped echoes of life; creatures whose hearts were emptied and stitched back together with Null’s cold craft. 

Once they take form, their tainted spark seeps into nearby plants, animals, even the very ground, raising new twisted spawn without anyone’s help. Built to endure, they never grow tired and never slumber. 

The Unbound will serve as the primary threat throughout your journey through Felysia.

## The Null KTTY: First Glimpse

Null’s research notes reference them as "Cyclebreaker‑1" but for general purposes he decided to name them the Null KTTY.

Born from the primary goal of looking to break the cycle of reincarnation that the KTTY naturally lives through, he asked the following questions

What if a KTTY never needed to re-incarnate again.

What if they were able to exist without a fragment of the Tamer’s soul; only clean executable purpose?

What happens to resonance when it is stripped of emotion?

Players will soon find out. 

The first synthetic Genesis strain of Null KTTY will appear in limited number, with exactly 100 Generation 0 KTTYs being granted to holders of the 9 Lives community role.
    
![Null KTTYs](/images/news/newscontent/nullktty.png)

Beyond that, Null KTTYs are said to be drawn to Tamers whose **Fallen** personalities lean toward detachment, control, or ambition.

Rumors suggest that there will be a number of hidden catalysts, corrupted ceremonies, and other methods not yet disclosed will also bestow willing tamers with the chance to receive one.

But be warned. There will only ever be a limited number of Generation 0 Null KTTYs. Look out for news down the line on how to obtain them.

The Null KTTY is **uncommon, but not impossible** and every one introduced tilts the balance between memory and emptiness.

> _A standard KTTY mirrors the Tamer’s inner light.  
> A Null KTTY mirrors the absence of that light and continues to echo long after emotion would have dimmed._

## Unearthing the Remaining Logs

## **Introducing The Ninth Circle**

Long before Tamers learned about the true nature of a KTTY and their reincarnation cycles, a quiet order was already watching; chronicling every rebirth, listening for the moment a soul crossed from the eighth return into the fabled ninth.

They called themselves **The Ninth Circle**, a cloister of seers, scribes, and wander-priests who believe that the ninth life is not an ending but a veil: a doorway through which the universe whispers its deepest pattern.

## **The Nine Lives Disciples**

Inside the Circle, full initiates bear the title **Nine Lives Disciples** (often shortened in tavern talk to simply _the “Nine-Lives”_).

Each Disciple carries:

-   a **Ninth Ledger**, inscribed with records of rare mutations observed over the entire history of the Ninth Circle’s existence.
    
As for where they stand within the world of Felysia:

| Faction                          | Relationship to the Ninth Circle                                                                                   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tamer Association**            | Wary allies. Tamers respect the Circle’s knowledge of reincarnation but distrust its secrecy and fascination with Null’s creations. |
| **One Eye Clan**                 | Uneasy collaborators. Mr Null uses the Circle as unwitting field researchers; some in the Clan see them as useful, others as heretics who still cling to symbolism. |
| **Independent Tamers & Scholars** | Seek the Circle for hidden lore or to verify anomalies—though few are granted full concordance.                   |

## Ties to Null and the One Eye Clan

![Null Record](/images/news/newscontent/nullrecord.png)

When Mr Null first approached the Ninth Circle, he spoke their language of cycles and thresholds, but twisted it: 

“You seek the truth within the ninth life cycle…let me show you a creature that walks beyond echoes entirely.” 

As a way of forming an alliance, he delivered one hundred Null KTTYs into their care.

To the Disciples, the offer was irresistible: living proof of a rumoured step past the veil. They accepted, believing these soulless constructs were keys to understanding what lies after the final life, even if their hearts stirred uneasily at the price: a bondless existence.

## Null KTTY Distribution

| Allocation Group                      | Amount                          |

|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Void Mantle Costume Ball**  | A deep-black cloak of drifting stars; a single silver eye glows on the chest.       | Cosmetic Null KTTY Exclusive      |
| **Echo Pedestal (Housing Item)** | A rune-carved stone dais that surrounds the displayed Null KTTY with a gentle halo of starlight. | Decorative; adds a small prestige bonus to the home. |
| **Genesis Disciple Badge**    | A gold icon beside the player's name in chat and leaderboards.                      | Social prestige                   |

## Hey Tamers,

Dev-KTTY here dropping by with a much needed update on what to expect from our quickly approaching Tamer Dispatch Mission Update.

## What Are Dispatch Missions?

The **Tamer Dispatch system** is our take on time-gated, off-screen missions. It’s a game layer inspired by RPG dispatch boards, only reimagined through the lens of KTTY World, with NFT integration, meaningful rewards, and long-term strategy.

Tamers can be assigned to missions through the **Tamer Mission Hub**, where you’ll choose objectives, build teams of 4 Tamers, and earn a range of collectible items.

Each account can run up to **5 missions concurrently**, totalling 20 deployed Tamers max that you can have sent out at any time.

You might ask **"Dev-KTTY…what if i have more than 20 Tamers?"**

And to that i would say that we already have you covered. It will be discussed below, but in short…Users will be rewarded for fielding optimally synergized teams. Optimal synergy will be different for each mission type. And each mission type has its own unique drop table.

tl:dr - Users that have a wide roster of tamers to select from will be in the best position to make the most of their playtime.

## Missions

There are a total of **25 unique Missions**, 5 for each mission type within Season 1.

## Mission Types

Each dispatch mission type offers different reward pools, challenge dynamics, and ideal team profiles:

### Exploration

Traverse unknown regions. Scout terrain, detect anomalies, and uncover caches.

### Hunt

Track elusive creatures or rogue KTTYs. High mobility and sensory skills shine here.

### Battle

Secure a hostile area or protect a target. Damage mitigation and disruption help tilt outcomes.

### Retrieval

Recover high-value relics or unstable tech. Precision and coordination make the difference.

### Harmonization

Stabilize zones under one eye influence. Best completed by teams attuned to synergy.

## Mission Duration & Yield

| Tier     | Duration (Hours) | Yield                                      |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Basic    | 1–2              | Low yield, quick cycles.                   |
| Standard | 4–8              | Balanced risk and return.                  |
| Long     | 12–24            | High item yield potential.                 |
| Epic     | 36–48            | Ideal for rare items or high-synergy teams.|

These durations ensure flexibility: whether you’re checking back in a few hours or sending your Tamers overnight, there’s always something moving forward.

## Synergy & Strategy

Dispatch success isn’t random. Behind every mission is a synergy engine built to reward smart team-building.

### Archetype

Every mission has an ideal combination of archetypes which, when reached, grants a synergy bonus. This means bonus rolls for rare and ultra-rare items are partially tied to the selection of archetypes you are able to assemble.

Not every mission needs a perfect setup, but there’s always more to unlock for those who plan.

### Personality

Each Tamer’s personality has been tagged with an alignment and behavioural role.

These are used to calculate a synergy score for your dispatch team. Personality synergy is invisible to the world but calculable by those of you who dig.

## Synergy Tiers:

| Tier           | % Score | Bonus Unlocked                         |
|----------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| Unstable Mix   | 0–39    | No bonus                               |
| Semi-Aligned   | 40–59   | +5% Paw                                |
| Synergized     | 60–79   | +10% Paw, +5% rare drop rate           |
| True Harmony   | 80–100  | +15% Paw, +10% rare drop rate          |

## Season 1 Dispatch Rewards

Every completed mission grants **Paw Tokens**, the standard in-game currency. In addition, you’ll receive item rewards based on mission type, duration, synergy, and a few surprises we’ll leave for players to uncover.

Here’s the Season 1 drop pool:

## Common

-   **Thread of Fate**: Used in rituals, item combining, and other low-cost crafting recipes.
    
-   **Neko Leaf**: A plant used to soothe, calm, or emotionally rebalance a KTTY.
    
-   **Glow Dust**: [Crafting Material] A soft luminous powder found around active relic sites.
    
-   **Resonant Bark**: [Crafting Material] Used in the development of tools or gear
    
-   **Shard Silk**: [Crafting Material] Lightweight but strong, used to make fine clothes and garments

![Commons](/images/news/newscontent/commons.png)

## Rare

-   **Tune Chip**: Modulates KTTY behavior or accelerates ability alignment.
    
-   **Pulse Lens**: Helps detect or trace hidden resonance patterns. Often used in research kits.
    
-   **Rift Alloy**: [Crafting Material] A flexible metal-like substance used to stabilize volatile weapons.
    
-   **Starweave Cog**: [Crafting Material] Used to modify mechanical KTTY constructs or time-based artifacts.

![Rares](/images/news/newscontent/rares.png)

## Ultra

Dormant Core: A sealed resonance catalyst used as a core modifier in the KTTY breeding process.

Echo Kernel: [Crafting Mat] A mysterious fragment that may recover a forgotten trait or memory.

Celestial Heart: [Crafting Mat] A synthetic relic used in the KTTY Reincarnation process

![Ultras](/images/news/newscontent/ultras.png)

## How Rewards Work

Completing a mission will give you a random amount of PAW Token every time.

This can be increased by qualifying for drop bonuses based on your assembled team.

You unlock Bonus Rolls depending on the Mission Duration/Tier you have selected as well as better chances to roll for rarer items.

Each Roll = 1 Drop.

So simply put, if you have access to a total of 4 rolls, you are guaranteed 4 Drops.

And the higher the tier the mission, the more chance that those drops come out to be rare or ultra rare drops.

## Advanced Strategy

A few questions to stimulate your noggins…

 - **What happens when your team shares no traits… and what happens when they share too many?**

 - **Do certain archetypes perform better at certain mission tiers or are some just more adaptable across the board?**

 - **Are shorter missions just about speed...or are they better suited for testing specific Tamer combinations?**

 - **How do items like Echo Kernels or Dormant Cores actually enter the reward pool...and can you increase those odds without realizing it?**

 - **Does personality alignment influence more than just rewards? What if it changes how missions resolve altogether?**

## Conclusion

Dispatch Missions aren’t just a side system. They’re a core rhythm of gameplay - rewarding collection, team theory-crafting, and long term planning.

We are quickly approaching our open testing phase which will be followed by the live V1.0 release shortly after.

We look forward to seeing how you choose to play…as well as what you uncover over time!

    tags: ['Announcement'],
    date: '2025-07-19',
    content: `
## Introduction

At KTTY WORLD Gaming Solutions Ltd., we believe that intellectual property (IP) rights are not just a legal formality; they are the foundation of Web3 ownership.

While many NFT projects continue to use community-owned NFTs in marketing campaigns without credit or compensation, we’re committed to doing things differently.

We’re proud to introduce the KTTY WORLD IP Rewards Framework, a community-first system that rewards our NFT holders whenever their NFT is used for promotional or commercial purposes by our project.

## The Value of Your NFT’s IP

When you purchase a KTTY WORLD NFT, you’re not just buying art; you’re investing in a digital identity that you own.

Your NFT may become iconic, recognizable, or representative of a movement within Web3. That has real value. We’ve seen time and time again in Web2 how brands license imagery, pay royalties, and respect creators’ rights.

In Web3, where ownership is on-chain and transparent, why should it be any different? This is why we’ve developed a transparent, automatic system to ensure you get paid when we use your NFT.

## The KTTY WORLD IP Rewards System

We’ve structured our reward system into three clear categories, based on the type of media and exposure involved:

![IP Rewards](/images/news/newscontent/iprewards.png)

## Use Case Definitions:

• Social Media Post (5 $RON):

Your NFT appears in a standard social media post (Twitter/X, Instagram, etc.) used to promote KTTY WORLD, an event, or initiative.

• Campaign Marketing (8 $RON):

Your NFT is featured in promotional assets such as banners, trailers, event posters, or email campaigns used for brand awareness or partnerships.

• Articles & Editorial (10 $RON):

Your NFT is used as a featured image or embedded in official articles, press releases, or educational content published by KTTY WORLD.

## Meet KORA: Our AI IP Management Assistant

To make this system scalable, efficient, and transparent, we’ve built KORA, our AI-powered modular ecosystem manager.

KORA continuously scans all KTTY WORLD content, from social media to blog posts and marketing decks, and cross-references every NFT image used with our on-chain ownership database. If she detects that the NFT used in our media belongs to a community member and not the core project, she automatically flags the usage, categorizes it, and issues the corresponding IP reward payment in $RON directly to the holder’s wallet.

This means:

• No forms to fill.

• No requests to submit.

• No delays.

Just real ownership and real reward, automatically.

## Why This Matters

We’re setting a new standard for what IP ownership in Web3 should look like:

• Empowering Creators:

Your NFT is a digital asset with utility and earning potential.

• Fostering Trust: Transparency and fair treatment strengthen our community bond.

• Real Utility: Beyond staking, governance, or metadata upgrades, IP rewards add a tangible economic layer to your NFT.

• Respecting Web3 Principles: Ownership on-chain means ownership with benefits, not just a JPG.

## How to Track Your IP Rewards

All payouts will be publicly trackable via our KTTY WORLD **Rewards Dashboard**, launching soon.

You’ll be able to:

• View usage logs

• Track earnings

• See how and where your NFT has appeared

KORA ensures these records are updated in real-time, and you can opt-in to receive notifications when your NFT is used.

## Implementation Notes

• Eligible NFTs:

Only NFTs purchased from verified KTTY WORLD collections are eligible for IP reward payments.

• Royalty Sync:

Rewards do not replace secondary royalties, but are additive, a new revenue layer.

• Team Transparency:

All project-owned NFTs will be disclosed publicly to avoid confusion over internal vs. community-owned NFTs.

• Opt-Out Option:

If you prefer not to have your NFT used in any promotions, you may opt out via your account settings on the dashboard.

## A Step Toward the Future

This system is more than just an incentive; it’s a statement of intent. At KTTY WORLD, we believe in building fairer ecosystems, where ownership means empowerment, and where your creativity and participation are respected and rewarded.

Whether you’re a collector, a builder, or just someone who loves great art, we’re here to make sure that your contributions matter in every sense of the word.

Let’s reshape what NFT ownership means, together.

## Hello Tamers!

We have been watching and thoroughly enjoying the reactions to the Tamer Dispatch Missions Update.

I'm just dropping in with an exciting early look at the next surprise we have in store for you.

Without further a due…i would like to introduce you to the…

## Tamer Gear Forge

![KTTY Forge](/images/news/newscontent/kttyforge.png)

Many of you have been wondering what you will do with the mass of items that you will be acquiring as you complete missions.

The first answer we will be giving you to that is…

CRAFTING GEAR!!!

That's right.

## Gear Blueprints

Gear blueprints will be acquired in a number of ways…

-   As Mission Rewards
    
-   Bought with $PAW
    
-   Created in the forge itself

Each Recipe will require a base amount of items to craft.

The quality of the result will be decided by a number of factors ranging from additional ingredient use, catalysts and $PAW.

Your creations will be able to be further upgraded to increase quality at a cost and a chance of failure.

These gear pieces will be trade-able in the near future in a tamer marketplace

That's all i can give you for now, but i will leave you with a sneak peak at the first recipe we created.

This is the Paw Paw Gauntlet.

## Blueprint: Paw Paw Gauntlet

What will you create? Only time will tell!

Until Next Time!

Thank you. Thank you and Thank you again.

## Hello Tamers!

# Season 2 Introduction

This next iteration will work slightly differently from our first, as we are adopting an **“Open-mission format.”**

What does this mean for you, the players?

Simply put - we’re shifting the focus toward the most important upcoming aspect of the project: **collecting items that will be used in the Tamer Forge.**

### Key points to note:

-   There will be no specified end dates.
    
-   We will announce more frequent reward periods for Tamers on the leaderboard.
    
-   A number of development patches will be introduced over the course of the **“Open-Mission”** in phases.  

Now, without further ado…on to what’s new!

# Update Preview

Here’s a rundown of what will be released as part of our **“Open-Mission”** rollout:

## Phase 1 (23/08/2025)

### 1. Mission Points Formula Changes

We’ve been hard at work revamping our mission points formula, with a focus on rewarding effort and smart team selection.

Back in Season 1, our formula was:

**Points = (Base Points × Tier Multiplier) + Synergy Bonus (Recommended Archetypes) + Mission Completion Modifiers**

This led to many players favoring Basic Mission spam, with little incentive to field stronger teams.

The updated formula introduces the following improvements:

-   **(UPDATE) Mission Tier Multiplier:** Adjusted to better differentiate basic vs. higher-tier missions.
    
-   **(NEW) Flat Mission Tier Bonuses:** Extra points awarded for higher-tier missions.
    
-   **(NEW) Personality Synergy Bonus:** More points for higher-synergy teams.
    
-   **(NEW) Streak Bonus:** A multi-level bonus for completing missions of the same type 3+ times.
    
-   **(NEW) Critical Success:** A small chance to earn **2× mission points.**
    
-   **(NEW) Jackpot:** A small chance to gain bonus points and a **+1 ultra item roll.**
    
### 2. Mission Reward Bonuses

**(NEW) Party Composition Bonuses:**

-   **Unified Blessing:** +20% Paw, +10% Rare Item Chance, +1 Additional Item Roll
    
-   **Resonant Overdrive:** +15% Paw, +15% Rare Item Chance
    
-   **Tension Surge:** +10% Paw, +10% Rare Item Chance, +1 Additional Item Roll
    
-   **Phase Harmony:** +10% Paw, +5% Rare Item Chance
    
Please Note: These particular bonuses are **NOT** stackable.

These bonuses join the already existing stack of bonuses and they are designed to reward diverse team comps and playstyles.

### 3. UI: Rewards Screen

We’ve added a **Mission Completion Rewards screen**, showing a full breakdown of your mission loot and unlocked bonuses.

Flex in front of your rivals by sharing directly to X (formerly known as Twitter).

### 4. Mobile Playability

Mobile users will finally be able to run missions on their mobile phones.

## Phase 2 (TBC)

### 5. Mission Stamina

We will soon introduce a **daily stamina system** for missions. Each mission will consume stamina, and once depleted you’ll need to wait for the daily reset...**unless you replenish it.**

-   **PAW Refills:** Up to **3 full restores per day** with PAW.
    
-   **KTTY Refills:** After PAW is used, KTTY can restore stamina. The first few refills restore **full stamina**, but subsequent ones restore only **50%.**
    
This system makes PAW the daily driver while keeping KTTY as a premium option for extended play without breaking balance.

### 6. Risk Re-roll Mechanic

You’ll be able to re-roll your mission rewards using **PAW** or **KTTY**:

-   **PAW Re-Roll:** Riskier - you may lose some rewards, keep them, or boost them.
    
-   **KTTY Re-Roll:** Premium and safer - you’ll either keep or boost rewards, never lose.

## Phase 3 (TBC)
    
### 7. Removal of 4-Tamer Requirement

To expand farming options, missions will soon allow as few as **1 Tamer.**

Synergy remains key: 4-Tamer parties will still offer the best rewards, but synergy bonuses will still be achievable with **2 or 3-Tamer teams.**

### 8. Mission Duration Reduction

You’ll soon be able to spend **PAW** or **KTTY** to reduce mission durations, up to a cap announced at launch.

### 9. Attendance Calendar

We’re introducing a **30-day Daily Attendance Calendar** to reward Tamers for consistent logins.

-   **Daily Rewards:** Useful items and resources.
    
-   **Weekly Bonuses:** Extra rewards for consecutive attendance.
    
-   **Grand Reward:** A major prize on the final day.
    
This will provide another way to earn materials in preparation for the **Tamer Forge Update.**

### 10. QOL Changes

We are looking to add a host of quality of life features that make engaging with the mission hub easier. 

A few to look out for are as follows:

-   **Recommended Archetype Filtering**
-   **Resend Tamer Team Feature**
-   **Optimal Team Auto Select**

As well as a few more helpful features that have been suggested along the way.

## Pay to Win vs Pay for Convenience

Our approach to using both **PAW** and **KTTY** is straightforward.

-   **PAW** is a free resource earned through missions.
    
-   **KTTY** is our premium project currency.
    
By supporting both, we ensure that all players can access convenience features, while also giving those who wish to invest further a premium path—striking a healthy balance between accessibility and progression.

## Conclusion

We’ve seen an incredible surge in activity since launch, and we want you to see firsthand the effort we’re putting in to make **Tamer Missions** one of the most rewarding gaming experiences on Ronin.

Your feedback and continued engagement are vital as we take the platform to the next level together.

Until next time,

# **Open Season Balance Patch 1 Notes**

Hello Tamers!

The new season of **Tamer Missions** is well underway, and with it comes our biggest set of balance and feature updates yet.  
Today we’re pulling back the curtain on the changes that will shape the meta for this new phase.

## **Main Changes**

Here’s everything coming with our **Open-Mission** rollout.

### **1. Points Rebalancing**

Back in Season 1, our formula looked like this:

**Points = (Base Points × Tier Multiplier) + Synergy Bonus + Mission Completion Modifiers**

It worked, but it didn’t _push_ high-performance teams far enough ahead, and some scaling elements were either too flat or too punishing.

In this new Season we’ve rebuilt the system from the ground up to make:

-   **Performance-based bonuses** more rewarding
    
-   **Tier scaling** more impactful
    
-   **Synergy** more valuable at all levels

#### **Mission Points Re-adjustment**

Points now scale more aggressively across mission tiers. Lower tiers remain accessible for casual play, while high-synergy, high-tier missions now pay off in a _big_ way.

| Mission Tier | Duration Range | Example Duration |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Basic**    | 0–2 hours     | 2h               |
| **Standard** | 4–8 hours     | 6h               |
| **Extended** | 12–23 hours   | 12h              |
| **Epic**     | 24–48 hours   | 48h              |

#### **Duration Efficiency Scaling**

The longer the mission, the more your **synergy %** is worth.

We now apply an _efficiency scale_ on top of the Tier Multiplier, meaning that two teams with the same synergy can earn very different scores depending on mission length.  

This curve rewards high-synergy teams more on long missions, especially beyond 80% synergy.

For example:

-   **40% Synergy** on a short mission feels like a modest boost
    
-   That same **40%** on an **Epic (48h)** run gets amplified by both the tier multiplier _and_ the efficiency curve
    
#### **Synergy Curve Adjustments**

We’ve smoothed the scaling so every % gain feels meaningful:

**40% Synergy** → Solid baseline, your team is starting to click  
**60% Synergy** → Competitive range, noticeable boost in rewards  
**80% Synergy** → Strong cohesion, major jump in points and loot  
**100% Synergy** → Maximum potential, often with Composition Bonuses layered on top

#### **Bonus Types You Can Stack**

**Perfect Match** – Exact recommended archetypes → extra points & 1 bonus roll

![Perfect Match](/images/news/newscontent/perfectmatch.png)

**Persistent Bond** – Same lineup for 3+ missions → loyalty bonus & 1 bonus roll

![Persistent Bond](/images/news/newscontent/persistentbond.png)

**Streak Bonus** – Chain missions of the same type without breaking streak → up to **Level 4** for huge point boosts

![Streak Bonus](/images/news/newscontent/hotstreak.png)

**Synergy Bands** – _Semi-aligned_, _Synergized_, and _True Harmony_ each grant Paw and rare item bonuses

![Semi-aligned](/images/news/newscontent/semi.png)
![Synergized](/images/news/newscontent/synergized.png)
![True Harmony](/images/news/newscontent/harmony.png)

**Party Composition Bonuses** – Special setups like _Prime Ascendance_ or _Unified Blessing_ add unique perks on top of everything else.

![Phase Harmony](/images/news/newscontent/phase.png)
![Tension Surge](/images/news/newscontent/pawpawgauntlet.png)
![Unified Blessing](/images/news/newscontent/unified.png)
![Resonant Overdrive](/images/news/newscontent/resonant.png)
![Prime Ascendance](/images/news/newscontent/pawpawgauntlet.png)

**Critical Points Chance** – Higher synergy increases the chance of a rare “Critical” result that multiplies your total points (1.25× to 2.5× depending on tier)

![Critical Success](/images/news/newscontent/critical.png)

**Jackpot Chance** – Ultra item rolls and bonus scaling points unlocked at Extended/Epic tiers, scaling from 1% at low synergy to 5% at max synergy

![Jackpot](/images/news/newscontent/lucky7.png)

#### **Partial Archetype Bonus**

Even if you can’t secure a Perfect Match, bringing 1–3 recommended archetypes will now grant partial point bonuses (+2, +4, or +8 points depending on matches). This makes near-perfect teams feel more rewarding without replacing the incentive to go all-in.

### **How to Max Your Points**

To break into **thousands of points** on a 48h Epic run, stack _everything_:

1.  **Hit 100% Synergy**
    
    -   Primes give a flat synergy boost (+6% each)
        
    -   4× Prime = **Prime Ascendance** (guaranteed 100% synergy)

#### **Other Ways to Hit 100% Synergy (Without Primes)**

While **4× Prime** is the easiest path to a guaranteed 100% Synergy, there are a few advanced team setups that can get you there too:

-   **Full Heroic or Full Fallen Lineup** – A perfectly balanced team made entirely of Heroic or entirely of Fallen personalities, each playing a different role, can push you to the cap.
    
-   **Heroic + Fallen Rivalry** – A mixed Heroic/Fallen team can still reach 100% if every member pairs well with the others and the lineup is tightly coordinated.
    
-   **Phase Harmony Build** – Special team combinations that create “Phase Harmony” can unlock powerful bonuses that help bridge the gap to full synergy.
    
-   **Perfectly Balanced Team** – A squad where every member complements the others without a weak link can, in rare cases, max out synergy without any Primes.
    
These builds are harder to pull off and usually require more planning than the Prime route, but they give skilled Tamers alternative ways to chase maximum rewards.
        
2.  **Secure a Perfect Match**
    
    -   Exact recommended archetypes = bonus points & loot roll
        
3.  **Maintain a Persistent Bond**
    
    -   Same team 3 missions in a row = loyalty bonus roll
        
4.  **Max Your Streak**
    
    -   Streak Level 4 = highest streak multiplier
        
5.  **Pick Long Missions**
    
    -   Epic (48h) = max Tier Multiplier + longest efficiency curve
        
6.  **Stack Party Composition Bonuses**
    
    -   _Prime Ascendance_, _Unified Blessing_, _Resonant Overdrive_, _Tension Surge_, _Phase Harmony_ all stack with synergy bands
        
#### **Example Points Simulation (Season 2)**

No bonuses except synergy applied, actual runs can be much higher.

| Synergy % | Basic (2h) | Standard (6h) | Extended (12h) | Epic (48h) |
|-----------|------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **0%**    | ~48 pts    | ~105 pts      | ~175 pts       | ~350 pts   |
| **40%**   | ~58 pts    | ~125 pts      | ~210 pts       | ~420 pts   |
| **60%**   | ~68 pts    | ~145 pts      | ~245 pts       | ~490 pts   |
| **80%**   | ~78 pts    | ~165 pts      | ~280 pts       | ~560 pts   |
| **100%**  | ~88 pts    | ~185 pts      | ~315 pts       | ~630 pts   |

### **2. Personality Tier & Synergy**

#### **Prime Personalities**

![Primes](/images/news/newscontent/primep.png)

Now the clear leaders of Felysia:

-   +6% Synergy per Prime in the party
    
-   4× Prime = **Prime Ascendance** + 50% Paw Token rewards + 10% Ultra item chance + 1 guaranteed Ultra roll (Epic only)
   
#### **Heroic & Fallen Personalities**

![Fallen](/images/news/newscontent/fallenp.png)
![Heroic](/images/news/newscontent/herop.png)

-   The old _penalty_ for mixing Heroic and Fallen is gone
    
-   If they share aspects, they can now score positively together
    
#### **Standard Personalities**

![Standard](/images/news/newscontent/standardp.png)

-   All-Standard teams now cap synergy lower than top-tier mixes
    
-   Still strong, but 100% Synergy now requires integrating Heroic, Fallen, or Prime

### **3. Bonuses UI Visual Overhaul**

-   Bonus badges are now visible in the Assign Tamers and Active Mission views

![Bonus Badges](/images/news/newscontent/bonusbadges.png)
    
-   Hover to see the exact bonus name and effect

![Badge Tooltips](/images/news/newscontent/bonustooltip.png)

### **4. Auto Assign Feature**

The new **Auto Assign** instantly builds your team based on your goal:

![Auto Assign](/images/news/newscontent/autoassign.png)

-   **Max Points** – Highest scoring potential
    
-   **Max Synergy** – Highest synergy %
    
-   **Max Item Rolls** – Loot-first priority
    
-   **Best Team** – Balanced approach

### **5. Misc**

-   Multiple mobile optimisations for smaller screens
    
-   Layout improvements for easier navigation
   
## **KTTY Utility**

With longer missions becoming the meta, we’re about to head into introducing $KTTY as a premium tool for power players in our next patch.

### **1. Mission Duration Reduction**

Spend **PAW** or **KTTY** to shorten missions, up to a set cap to preserve balance.

### **2. Mission Stamina**

Missions will consume daily stamina.

Once empty, you can:

-   Use **PAW** – Up to 3 full restores per day
    
-   Use **KTTY** – After PAW is used, KTTY refills give full stamina at first, then 50% for subsequent uses

**PAW** = the daily driver  
**KTTY** = the premium fuel

This is just the opening move in our larger **$KTTY** utility plan so make sure to grab some if your bag is running thin. From this point out we will continuously be adding ways to utilise your $KTTY, paving the way to making this a living, breathing and functional ecosystem!

## **Conclusion**

Since launch, activity has exploded, and every patch is designed to raise the ceiling for what’s possible while keeping the loop rewarding for all player types.

Your feedback and theory-crafting fuel our momentum. Together, we’re building one of the most rewarding gaming experiences on Ronin.

Until next time,
